            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt least 40 years ago, Game of the Generals game made a commotion in the world of chess 
            before making its way to be one of the renowned and popular board games in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was controversial to most Filipino board gamers back then, especially for avid Chess players, 
            because they thought that the game was meant to replace or "remove" chess.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChess was big and popular during that era in the country, especially in schools and competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Game of the Generals is often shortened for GG or GOG. This game was invented by Sofronio H. Pasola, Jr.,
            with the inspiration of his son Ronnie Pasola.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Pasolas first tried the Game of the Generals on a chessboard. Even then, the pieces had no particular arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere were no spies in the experimental game, but after Ronnie Pasola remembered the James Bond movies and Mata Hari 
            (a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I), he added the Spies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMaking the pieces hidden was the idea of the Pasolas after remembering card games.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Game of the Generals' public introduction was on February 28, 1973. As quickly as a steamroller offensive, 
            GG started to outsell Chess immediately after its formal public introduction.
